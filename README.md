# PromptBlocks

PromptBlocks is an open-source web application concept designed to help users create better AI prompts by assembling "Prompt Blocks" in a visual, modular way—similar to Scratch.

This project explores the idea of a "prompt box" (see [PromptMD](https://prompt.md) for related concepts). The core idea is to allow users to drag and drop different components (like Role, Task, Context, Tone) to build structured and effective prompts.

## Project Purpose: Benchmarking

Beyond the application concept itself, this repository serves as a **benchmarking project**. 

Changes and subdirectories in this repository represent tests of different AI models (like GLM, Codex, Gemini, etc.). The goal is to evaluate how well different AIs can understand the requirements in [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md) and generate a working application based on them.
